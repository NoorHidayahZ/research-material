# The top list of academic research databases
Whether you are writing a thesis, dissertation, or research paper it is a key task to survey prior literature and research findings. More likely than not, you will be looking for trusted resources, most likely peer-reviewed research articles. Academic research databases make it easy to locate the literature you are looking for. We have compiled the top list of trusted academic resources to help you get started with your research:

| No | Database | Description | 
| ----- | ----- | ------ |
| 1 | [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com) | Scopus is one of the two big commercial, bibliographic databases that cover scholarly literature from almost any discipline. Beside searching for research articles, Scopus also provides academic journal rankings, author profiles, and an h-index calculator. |
| 2 | [Web of Science](https://mjl.clarivate.com/search-results)| Web of Science also known as Web of Knowledge is the second big bibliographic database. Usually, academic institutions provide either access to Web of Science or Scopus on their campus network for free. |
| 3 | [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)  | PubMed is the number one resource for anyone looking for literature in medicine or biological sciences. PubMed stores abstracts and bibliographic details of more than 30 million papers and provides full text links to the publisher sites or links to the free PDF on PubMed Central (PMC). |
| 4 | [ERIC](https://eric.ed.gov/) | For education sciences, ERIC is the number one destination. ERIC stands for Education Resources Information Center, and is a database that specifically hosts education-related literature. |
| 5 | [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp)  | IEEE Xplore is the leading academic database in the field of engineering and computer science. It's not only journal articles, but also conference papers, standards and books that can be search for. |
| 6 | [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/) | ScienceDirect is the gateway to the millions of academic articles published by Elsevier. 2,500 journals and more than 40,000 e-books can be searched via a single interface. |
| 7 | [Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ)](https://doaj.org/) | The DOAJ is very special academic database since all the articles indexed are open access and can be accessed freely of charge. |
