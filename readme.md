# The top list of academic research databases
Whether you are writing a thesis, dissertation, or research paper it is a key task to survey prior literature and research findings. More likely than not, you will be looking for trusted resources, most likely peer-reviewed research articles. Academic research databases make it easy to locate the literature you are looking for. We have compiled the top list of trusted academic resources to help you get started with your research:

| No | Database | Description | 
| ----- | ----- | ------ |
| 1 | [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com) | Scopus is one of the two big commercial, bibliographic databases that cover scholarly literature from almost any discipline. Beside searching for research articles, Scopus also provides academic journal rankings, author profiles, and an h-index calculator. |
| 2 | [Web of Science](https://mjl.clarivate.com/search-results)| Web of Science also known as Web of Knowledge is the second big bibliographic database. Usually, academic institutions provide either access to Web of Science or Scopus on their campus network for free. |
| 3 | [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)  | PubMed is the number one resource for anyone looking for literature in medicine or biological sciences. PubMed stores abstracts and bibliographic details of more than 30 million papers and provides full text links to the publisher sites or links to the free PDF on PubMed Central (PMC). |
| 4 | [ERIC](https://eric.ed.gov/) | For education sciences, ERIC is the number one destination. ERIC stands for Education Resources Information Center, and is a database that specifically hosts education-related literature. |
| 5 | [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp)  | IEEE Xplore is the leading academic database in the field of engineering and computer science. It's not only journal articles, but also conference papers, standards and books that can be search for. |
| 6 | [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/) | ScienceDirect is the gateway to the millions of academic articles published by Elsevier. 2,500 journals and more than 40,000 e-books can be searched via a single interface. |
| 7 | [Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ)](https://doaj.org/) | The DOAJ is very special academic database since all the articles indexed are open access and can be accessed freely of charge. |

# 13 Best Bibliography Maker Tools: Online & Plug-In Citation Generators
Bibliography maker tools are some of the more helpful solutions for students and researchers alike. Itâ€™s no secret that many researchers wish to do away with this part after a laboring through their research methodology and other crucial parts of their papers. But various editing styles and their accompanying citation formats ensure that rendering this part of the paper does not come straightforward as it should.

Today, there is a plethora of solutions in the market that were not available decades ago. These include self-created databases and web-based citation generators (Emanuel, 2013). With an array of options available, one might be asking whatâ€™s the best citation generator to use.

| No | Name | Description | 
| ----- | ----- | ------ | 
| 1 | Mendeley Cite | Mendeley Cite is a plug-in for Microsoft Word that lets you cite sources without leaving your document. The plug-in appears in the References tab in Word which allows you to automatically add in-text citations and generate bibliographies. | 
| 2 | Zotero | Zotero is a free, open-source research tool that lets you collect research material, organize them, and create references and bibliographies. Zotero has a downloadable desktop app for Mac and Windows. They also have Zotero Connector, a browser extension that allows you to save webpages online and sync it to the desktop app. | 
| 3 | EndNote | Endnote is a complete reference management software that promises users to research smarter. Aside from your own library where you can gather, sort, and share your research, it also has a Cite-As-You-Write plug-in for Word and Mac. The plug-in bridges your EndNote library and Microsoft Word or Apple Pages so you can seamlessly cite sources without switching to different interfaces. | 
| 4 | Paperpile | Paperpile is a subscription-based reference management system that lets you store, organize, and share your research all from one place. The paid version includes beta version of Word plug-ins for Mac and Windows. However, Paperpile also offers a free reference manager for Google Docs. | 
| 5 | Cite This For Me | Cite This For Me has a decent amount of tools that will make citation easier and faster. Though it can only support a moderate number of source types, it makes up for it in the array of citation styles available. While it has the usual download, export, and copy-and-paste tools that other citation generators have, its collaboration features make it unique. | 
| 6 | Citation Machine | Citation Machine is a free online bibliography generator thatâ€™s also straightforward to use. Like most citation generators, users are asked to identify the source material, look for it via URL or search term, and supply any missing information to complete the citation. | 
| 7 | EasyBib | EasyBib is another free, easy-to-use online bibliography maker. Like Citation Machine, EasyBib is part of the online learning platform Chegg Service. This probably explains why it has a similar interface and features to Citation Machine. | 
| 8 | BibMe | BibMe is an online bibliography generator that makes the tedious task of citation more convenient. | 
| 9 | CiteMaker | Touting itself as a best-in-class referencing tool, CiteMaker is a bibliography maker that promises fast output in three easy steps (CiteMaker, n.d.). | 
| 10 | Citefast | Citefast is an online citation generator that promises not only a free tool but also a fast one. Citefast can automatically generate citations out of web page URLs, ISBNs, and more. You can also type in the information yourself. Fields for reference data have tips that you can hover over so you know how to properly format your sources. | 
| 11 | KnightCite | KnightCite is a free online citation generation service run by the Hekman Library at Calvin College. It was created by a student of the school with the aim of building a quick and reliable citation tool for other students (Calvin University, n.d.). | 
| 12 | Citation Builder | Citation Builder is a free online bibliography maker hosted by the North Carolina State University library. It has a rather simplistic interface with dropdowns for the resource type and citation style. You just have to choose the options from the dropdown and manually fill out the needed information for the resource type. Once you hit Submit, it will generate a citation for you which you can then copy and paste to a document (NC State University, n.d.). | 
| 13 | OttoBib | OttoBib is a straightforward online citation generator that lets you cite books using their International Standard Book Number (ISBNs). You can cite multiple ISBNs as long as they are separated with commas. OttoBib supports MLA, APA, Chicago/Turabian, BibTeX, and Wikipedia (OttoBib, n.d.). |
