# Research Group: Artificial intelligence & Computational Informatics

## Definition
Research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the study of intelligent agents, which can include software and machines, that can perceive their environment, reason about it, and take actions to achieve specific goals. The goal of AI research is to develop algorithms, models, and systems that can perform tasks that typically require human-level intelligence, such as perception, reasoning, and decision-making.

On the other hand, research in Computational Informatics is the study of how computational methods and tools can be used to analyze and understand complex data, including biological data, social networks, and large datasets. This research aims to develop algorithms and models that can extract meaningful information and insights from data, and to develop tools and technologies that can be used to analyze and visualize data.

Both AI and Computational Informatics are highly interdisciplinary fields that require expertise in computer science, mathematics, statistics, and other disciplines. The goal of research in both fields is to develop new technologies, tools, and methods that can be used to address complex problems and improve our understanding of the world around us.
