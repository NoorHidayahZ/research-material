# SLR: Limitations for thyroid disease in high dimensional dataset

A **systematic review** is a scholarly synthesis of the evidence on a clearly presented topic using critical methods to identify, define and assess research on the topic.[1] A systematic review extracts and interprets data from published studies on the topic, then analyzes, describes, and summarizes interpretations into a refined conclusion.[1][2] For example, a systematic review of randomized controlled trials is a way of summarizing and implementing evidence-based medicine.[3]
